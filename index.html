<!-- Updated Bio section below -->
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Andr L. Mays. I am currently living in Riverside, CA. 
My Background: As a 52-year- Black American male, it is a testament to the adage that it is never too late to pursue one's passions. Born and raised in a close-knit community, I have always possessed an innate curiosity and love for technology. However, life took him on a different path, and I worked in a few utterly unrelated fields for most of his adult life.
My Career Transition: Dissatisfied with the monotony of my previous job and yearning for a change, I boldly decided to
embark on a new career path. Determined to pursue my long-held dream of becoming a developer, I enrolled in the UCR Full Stack Bootcamp program. 
My Boot Camp Experience: The boot camp was intense and
transformative. Over several months, I immersed myself in coding, learning various programming languages, and honing my problem-solving skills. Despite the challenges of learning a new discipline, my perseverance and dedication helped me excel in the program.
My Professional Growth: Following the boot camp, I will continue to expand his knowledge and skills by engaging in personal projects and participating in coding communities. I will become well-versed in web development, mastering front-end and back-end technologies. My commitment to continuous learning and growth allowed me to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. 
My Career Success:  My hard work paid off when I landed my first job as a PC technician. My diverse background, coupled
with my strong technical skills and problem-solving abilities,
proved to be valuable assets in the workplace. Through my
contributions, I significantly impacted the projects I
worked on, earning the respect and admiration of my colleagues.
My Community Engagement: Beyond my professional achievements, I have actively advocated diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. I believe in creating opportunities for
underrepresented communities and one-day mentoring aspiring
developers from similar backgrounds, providing guidance and support to help them navigate their journeys. 
My Interests: When not immersed in coding or mentoring others, I enjoy exploring his artistic side through reading about history and listening to live jazz. I value spending quality time with my loved ones and finding solace in nature, often going on hiking trips to unwind and find inspiration. In conclusion, I exemplify the power of determination and the willingness to pursue one's passions at any age. My journey from a career transition through boot camp to becoming a successful developer inspires others who may be considering a similar path. My dedication, professional growth, and commitment to positively impacting the world showcase my resilience and the vast potential within all of us to forge new paths and achieve our goals.<i> "By waiting until I master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before applying for a career, I may miss my opportunity to be employed." </i>
